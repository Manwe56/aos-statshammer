### Contribution guidelines

As you noticed, the Spearhead and factions are using the english names for units and weapons. If you create new entries and want to share it here, please use the english names as you are finding them in the AOS app.

A lot of units can be buff with various bonuses (for example a units that charged may have a significant increase in the damage outputs). If you think it is worth having this buffed version directly in the available units, in this case, please add the buffed unit in addition to the non buffed one, and add in the unit name the conditions. For example You may find a "Vindictors" and a "Vindictors (vs 5+ Infantry)" units. For ranged weapons, please add a "(ranged)" in the weapon profile name so that it is easy to identify what is ranged and what is not. 

There is certainly other conventions to put in place, don't hesitate to give me feedback about it!
