## Rankings

Thanks to all the contributors, we have the warscrolls of more than 500 units, over 20 factions. As you noticed in the import/export section, only the units described in the indexes are covered, and for the factions with now battletomes, some units are not available or inacurate. 
Note that if you own a battletome, you can complete the index by importing your favorite faction from the import export section, add all the missing warscrolls, and export it as a battletome file. Then you import this battletome in the import export section, and the additional/modified units will be available in this ranking section.

If you are not finding units from your favorite faction, maybe it is one of the few factions that have not been covered yet (Skaven, Seraphon, Beat of Chaos, BoneSplitters). Or simply there have been errors when entering manually all the warscrolls. If you have updates or corrections, feel free to reach out to me on discord to propose an updated file for a faction.

Keep in mind that this feature is in Beta, and you will certainly find several errors in the results bellow.
